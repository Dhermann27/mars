                    <p>MUUSA is an intentionally inclusive community that
                                  welcomes everyone regardless of their biological sex or gender

                                  state law. Please contact us to make special arrangements for
                                  any camper who would prefer alternatives.</p>

                                  strongly suggest that you seek out your own roommate using

                   <p>A sponsor is required if the camper will be under the age of 18 on the first
                   day of camp and a parent or legal guardian is not attending for the entire length
                   of time that the camper will be at mini-MUUSA. A sponsor is asked to attend
                   the informational meetings in the parents\' stead, and if the camper is asked to
                   leave for any reason, the sponsor will be required to assist the camper home.</p>
                   <p>If you are having difficulty finding a sponsor, please let us know using the
                   Contact Us form above. Oftentimes, we have adults in your area who are willing to
                   volunteer, and may also be willing to offer transportation.</p>',
